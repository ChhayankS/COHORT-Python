Welcome to the COHORT 2024 Repository!

This repository will serve as a central hub for the code examples covered in COHORT 2024 under the guidance of Deepak Maurya. I'll be consistently adding new files to this repo, aligning with the daily curriculum of the cohort on the topic of "Python Programming".

What to expect:

Original Code: Code examples taught by Deepak Maurya during the COHORT 2024 sessions on the topic of "Python Programming".

Feel free to:

Explore the existing code examples.
Contribute by suggesting improvements or fixing errors.
Ask questions and seek clarification on any topic.
Let's embark on this learning journey together!

Best regards,
